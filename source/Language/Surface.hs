A structure declaration represents sentences such as

```
A preorder is a set P equipped with a reflexive transitive endorelation â‰¤.
```
or simply
```
A preorder is a set equipped with a reflexive transitive endorelation.
```

Special importance is placed on the carrier of a structure. When `S` is a structure,
then `x : S` is elaborated to `x : X`, where `X` is the carrier of `S`.

The ingredients of a structure are things like special values (e.g. a neutral element),
operations (e.g. a group operation), relations, or other data (e.g. a topology).

Properties of a structures are proposition that an structures and its ingredients have
to satisfy. For example, we might require an operation to be associative or
a relation to be reflexive.
