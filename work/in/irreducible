\begin{definition}
  We say that \( p \) is irreducible iff
  \( 0\neq p\neq 1 \) and for every \( k\in\mathbb{N} \)
  we have that \( k\mid p\) implies \( k = 1 \) or \( k = p \).
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Some natural number is irreducible.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
  \( n \) divides \( n \).
\end{theorem}
